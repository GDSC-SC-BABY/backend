1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
   Replace `<repository-url>` with the URL of the Git repository where the Spring Boot application is hosted.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```
   cd <project-directory>
   ```
   Replace `<project-directory>` with the name of the directory created after cloning the repository.

3. **Build the Application:**
   ```
   ./mvnw clean package
   ```
   This command will use Maven Wrapper (`mvnw`) to clean the project and package it into a JAR file.

4. **Run the Application:**
   ```
   java -jar target/<your-application>.jar
   ```
   Replace `<your-application>` with the name of the generated JAR file.

5. **Access the Application:**
   Once the application is running, you can access it using a web browser or any HTTP client by visiting `http://localhost:8080` (assuming it's configured to run on the default port).

Make sure you have JDK and Maven installed on your system to build and run the Spring Boot application. Additionally, ensure that any required dependencies specified in the `pom.xml` file are available.
